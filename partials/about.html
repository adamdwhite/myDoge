    <!-- About, static page, PURPOSE of APP, thanks page -->
    <p class="lead">This app was created for NSS Front-End Capstone project, Cohort 21. Goals: _To make use of an API. _To achieve a broader knowledge of Angular directives and controllers: >To empower sophisticated searching and filtering >To template QA forms for expandability
        _To quickly surface lots of insightful information with minimal user effort (aka good UX/UI) Lessons Learned: _Writing and diagraming every feature and method in plain, logical speech. This will reveal the best approach to the code. _Commit every
        time something new is acheived, no matter how small. _Don't underestimate the patience of your mentors. Everybody was once a noob. _Styling is never finished, so slap a boot-whatever template on and keep working on the functions. The purpose of
        the app is to inform potential dog adopters about the many varied characteristics regarding hundreds of dog breeds. Additionally, potential adopters may answer a questionnaire regarding the specifics of their lifestyle, in an effort to match them
        with the best breeds to adopt.
    </p>
    <p> The available data may only provide a broad set of guidelines, as it regards characteristics of "pure" breeds. The highly adaptable nature of dogs means that each potential adoptee should be compassionately considered on an individual basis. Furthermore,
        we should all be aware of the careful considerations regarding ethical treatment and precautions involved with adoption of a pure breed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each dog breed has a fascinating history, representing countless specific traits. While crossing of breeds may not be acceptable for show-quality, it is absolutely beneficial to most bloodlines, and will more likely result in wonderful, healthy offspring,
        revealing infinite combinations of the traits detailed here. Therefore, if you are looking to adopt, please consider rescuing a dog from a shelter. Older dogs in shelters are most often overlooked, but may be a perfect fit in your given situation.
